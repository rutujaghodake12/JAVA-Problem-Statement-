/*A small adventure on Java Primitive Data Types
Let's put your skills to the test with a coding exercise based on our previous lecture on declaring primitive data types and storing data in Java!
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Write a Java code that declares a double variable with the name piValue and assign a value 3.14 to it.
Once the assignment of the value is completed, print the value inside the variable using the System.out.println() statement
On the right hand side, you will see a Java class with the name Exercise which has a main method inside it.
For now, let not worry about what is class and method in Java, we are going to talk in the coming sections.
Your goal is to write a Java code inside the main method based on the above problem statement.
Once you completed writing your code, click on the Run tests button to know the result.

public class Exercise2 {
    public static void main (String[] args) {

        /* Write your code below */

        double piValue=3.14;
        System.out.println(piValue);
    }


}
