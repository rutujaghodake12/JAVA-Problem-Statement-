/*Boolean Fun: Java's True or False Adventures
Let's put your skills to the test with a coding exercise based on our previous lecture on declaring boolean data types and storing data in them !
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Write a Java code that declares a first boolean variable with the name believesInAliens and assign a value false to it. Followed by second boolean variable with the name needsMoreCoffee and assign a value true

Once the assignment of the value is completed, print the value inside the variables using the System.out.println() statement
Expected Output:
false
true
On the right hand side, you will see a Java class with the name Exercise which has a main method inside it.
For now, let not worry about what is class and method in Java, we are going to talk in the coming sections.
Your goal is to write a Java code inside the main method based on the above problem statement.
Once you completes writing your code, click on the Run tests button to know the result.

public class Exercise3 {
    public static void main (String[] args) {

        /* Write your code below */

        boolean believesInAliens=false;
        boolean needsMoreCoffee=true;
        System.out.println(believesInAliens);
        System.out.println(needsMoreCoffee);

    }
